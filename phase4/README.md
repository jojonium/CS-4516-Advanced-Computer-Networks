CS 4516: Advanced Computer Networks, Phase 4
============================================

Cole Granof and Joseph Petitti

To run this program, run `sudo python3 /home/tc/analyzeFlows`. It will print
statistics including classification for each burst detected in the same format
as previous phases.

We had to increase TinyCore's virtual machine's memory to 1024 GiB to get all
the training data to fit on it.

We retrained the model on TinyCore using more data due to a 32 bit/64 bit
incompatibility with scikit-learn.

Definition of a Flow
--------------------

A flow is defined as all of the traffic between two IP/port pairings with the
same protocol. Therefore, a flow includes all packets in both directions.

Classification Vectors
----------------------

Our classification model is a random forest classifier generated by creating
feature vectors from test flows with the following information:

* Byte ratio (bytes sent / bytes received, or reciprocal)
* Packet ratio (packets sent / packets received, or reciprocal)
* Mean packet length
* Standard deviation of packet lengths (zero if n <= 2)
* Packet length kurtosis
* Packet length skew
* Mean time gap between each packet (zero if n <= 1)
* Time gap kurtosis
* Time gap skew
* Min packet length
* Max packet length
* Min time gap
* Max time gap
* Protocol (1 for TCP, 0 for UDP)

Python Packages
---------------

We used Python 3 for this phase. Required packages:

* scipy
* kamene
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* pickle
