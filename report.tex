\section{Overview}

\textbf{What the project consisted of and what you implemented.} This project
was inspired by a paper we read for class \cite{tscm16}.

\section{Phase Details}

This section describes the implementation of each phase of the project.

\subsection{Phase 1}

How was the gateway configured?

\lipsum

\subsection{Phase 2}

How was traffic logging implemented?

\lipsum

\subsection{Phase 3}

What classification algorithm did you use? Which features? How many traces did
you use for training and evaluation? Which accuracy did you obtain?

\lipsum

\subsection{Phase 4}

How was the classifier integrated into the traffic logger?

\section{Lessons Learned and Limitations}

Describe anything that you tried during any of the phases that did not work.
Also describe limitations of your implementation and anything that did not
perform according to your expectations.
